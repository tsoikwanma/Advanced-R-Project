# Carbon Emissions Interactive Dashboard

This project is an interactive web-based dashboard built using **R Shiny** for visualizing and analyzing carbon emissions data by country, sector, and year. It leverages **C++ (via Rcpp) and vectorization in R** for high-performance backend calculations to ensure fast, efficient interactivity even with large datasets.

## Purpose

The goal of this dashboard is to provide users with a flexible tool to explore trends in carbon emissions across different sectors and regions over time. The emission data visualizations can help explore trends and carry out comparative analysis (e.g. line plots, bar graphs, pie chat, maps). It is also a flexible and reproducible exploration tool: 

- Available for new emission data upload for future analysis
- Able to filter and export data source used
- Allowed to save plots / charts if available

#### How to use?

It is required to download all the R files with the CSV dataset, and then running the codes only from the top to bottom on app.R will work ;)
